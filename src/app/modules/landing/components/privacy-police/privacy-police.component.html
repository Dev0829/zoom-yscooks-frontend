        customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers and servers in which
        we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment. This is all done to prevent any
        loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure or modification of the user's personal information under our
        control. The company also uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) for authentication and private communications to build
        users' trust and confidence in the internet and website use by providing simple and secure access and
        communication of credit card and personal information.
